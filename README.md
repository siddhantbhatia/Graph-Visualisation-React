## Usage

- First initiate the node.js server by following the `Backend` instruction. 
- In another terminal tab, run the `Frontend` application

### Backend: `cd server && node index.js`

Runs the server listening at port: 3001

### Frontend: `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### Build: `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
